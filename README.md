# STM32 Bare-Metal Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **bare-metal embedded projects** developed for STM32 microcontrollers.  
All projects are implemented using **direct register-level programming**, without relying on HAL libraries or any RTOS.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a clear understanding of:
- STM32 peripheral architecture
- ARM Cortex-M core features
- UART , SPI driver level programming

## Target Platform
- Microcontroller Family: STM32
- Architecture: ARM Cortex-M (M4)
- Toolchain: ARM GCC
- IDE: STM32CubeIDE (used for project creation and debugging)
